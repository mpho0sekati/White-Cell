# Project Updates — 2026-02-19

Summary of recent reviewer actions and checks performed locally in the repository.

## Actions performed

- Checked `whitecell/cli.py` for syntax errors using:
  - `python -m py_compile whitecell/cli.py`
  - Result: No syntax errors reported.

- Inspected `whitecell/cli.py` contents for structure and obvious issues.
  - File reviewed: `whitecell/cli.py` (interactive CLI implementation, command handlers, exports).

## Notes

- No runtime/import-time checks were executed; external imports may raise errors when imported or when running the CLI.
- The CLI file appears well-structured; suggested next steps below will help validate runtime behavior.

## Suggested next steps

1. Run a lightweight import test to catch import-time failures:

```bash
python -c "import whitecell.cli"
```

2. Run the CLI interactively to exercise behavior:

```bash
python -m whitecell.cli
```

3. Run the project's test suite (if available) and linting.

4. If everything looks good, push this documentation to the repository remote.
